This directory (/home/simjo484/master_thesis/Master_Thesis/BSF_finetuning/json)
is for files that are related to the image paths used when fine-tuning BSF.

There should be a .json file called "brats21_folds.json" in this dir. This file
describes the hierarchical structure of image paths for patients in the Brats training data.

If "brats21_folds.json" is not present (!!!). Fear not. Context is available here:
https://github.com/Project-MONAI/research-contributions/tree/main/SwinUNETR/BRATS21

The direct link to the .json is here:
